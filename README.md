🎉 Jiggle Chill Time
A fast-paced party game for PC – solo or with friends!

Welcome to Jiggle Chill Time, a chaotic and fun-filled party game designed for up to 4 local players—or go solo and take on quirky NPCs! Each overworld level contains three randomized minigame stages that challenge your reflexes, timing, and teamwork (or sabotage skills).

Jump, race, bump, and laugh your way through a series of mini-challenges in colorful environments, then return to the overworld and push forward to the next chaotic set of games.

🕹️ Key Features:

Singleplayer or local multiplayer: Battle friends or CPU players!

Multiple overworld levels: Each one with its own twist and progression path.

Mini-games galore: A variety of fast, silly, and skill-based games in each world.

Lightweight Windows PC build: No bloat, just instant party fun.

🎮 Note from the developer: This is a side project I’ve worked on while also building my own custom game engine and working on another larger game. I’d love to expand this further when I get the time—stay tuned for updates!
